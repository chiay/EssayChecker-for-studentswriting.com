         The fox and the goat are different in many ways. One way they are different is that the goat was nice enough to help the fox; however, she was very foolish to help the fox. The text states, "When the goat upbraided him for breaking his promise, he turned around and cried out, 'You foolish old fellow! If you had as many brains in your head as you have hairs in your beard, you would never have gone down before you had inspected the way up, nor have exposed yourself to dangers from which you had no means of escape.'" This shows that the goat is different from the fox. Another way the characters differ is that the fox was the opposite of the goat in terms of personality. The fox was mean but smart. The text states, "'If,' said he, 'you will place your forefeet upon the wall and bend your head, I will run up your back and escape, and will help you out afterwards.' The goat readily assented and the fox leaped upon his back. Steadying himself with the Goatâ€™s horns, he safely reached the mouth of the well and made off as fast as he could." To clarify, the fox was very mean and outsmarted the goat. Thus, the goat and the fox are different in many ways.

         Gerda is the protagonist in the story.  I think this because the first paragraph opens only about Gerda. The text states, "Gerda was an only child... Gerda was taken everywhere by her parents... Gerda had no friends."  In addition, the story talks about the Snow Queen being evil so she might be the antagonist. Also the text states," The Snow Queen traveled around screaming and yelling at children." For these reasons, I think Gerda is the protagonist the Snow Queen is the antagonist.
