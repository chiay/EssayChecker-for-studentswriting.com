         Ali Baba had to hide his findings for a few reasons. One reason Ali Baba had to hide his findings was because he didn't want the robbers find them. The passage states, "... he wanted to keep it secret and for himself." In conclusion, Ali Baba  kept it secret to keep for himself.

         Gerda is the protagonist in the story.  I think this because the first paragraph opens only about Gerda. The text states, "Gerda was an only child... Gerda was taken everywhere by her parents... Gerda had no friends." In addition, the story talks about the Snow Queen being evil so she might be the antagonist. Also the text states," The Snow Queen traveled around screaming and yelling at children." For these reasons, I think Gerda is the protagonist the Snow Queen is the antagonist.
